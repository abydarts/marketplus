    <p class="marginbottom20">	As an Author on the Envato Marketplaces you are eligible to receive between <?php echo $plan->percentage_from.'%'; ?> and <?php echo $plan->percentage_to.'%'; ?> of every sale should you choose to sell only items that are not sold elsewhere. 
    <br>
    Being an exclusive author simply means that any items you sell on an Envato Marketplace are unique to our libraries.
    <br>
    You are entitled to sell other items elsewhere, but not the same ones. 
    <br>
    This helps keep the marketplaces healthy and unique, and ensures buyers arenâ€™t just browsing through items they could get anywhere. So to sum up:</p>
